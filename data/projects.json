This is achieved by combining decentralised entities with programability to provide digital Infrastructure as an Executable (single-click deployment). Entity > Token > PreSale > DEX Listing > Staking > Asset Backing and much more in a single execution, initially available for operators with a low entry threshold to encourage participation.\n\nThe ecosystem is bootstrapped by the Crypto Factor Token which serves as an exchange of value and entry criteria for product platform use. We will be embarking on a DeFi exploration with all concepts that are robustly developed and considered production ready integrated into the Product Platform for user/operators to use and build with.\n\nCrypto Factor does not provide advice or funding meaning the ecosystem forms a true enabler to allow others to build out DeFi Solutions in any direction to any extent to fulfil their requirements.",
